    Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle game.
The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids
that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid,
which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
    The game guarantees that each puzzle has a unique solution.
    The game generates a new puzzle each time you start a new game.
    The game has a simple and intuitive interface, with a clean design that allows you to focus on the game.

    TIPS!

    - Use arrows to move around the grid and type a number to place it in the cell or
